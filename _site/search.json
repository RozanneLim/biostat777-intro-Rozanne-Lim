You also are asked to practice with some command-line and version control skills more formally.\n\n\nPlease use this Quarto file (.qmd) and fill in the requested components by adding the URLs pointing to the GitHub repositories and deployed websites. Render this file to a HTML file.\nYou will push the .qmd file and rendered HTML file to a private GitHub repostory on GitHub classroom. The link to create a private GitHub repository for yourself to complete Project 1 will be posted in CoursePlus\n\n\n\n\n\n\nNote\n\n\n\nThis creates an empty repository. You will need to clone the reopository locally, add your code, and push your code from your local repo to the remote repository on GitHub Classroom when ready.\nPlease show all the code, if relevant to a section.\n\n\nThe TAs will grade the contents in the GitHub repo by cloning the repo and checking for all the things described below."

At minimum it should include your name, a short summary about yourself (max 2-3 sentences), and a picture of something you enjoy to do for fun (or a picture of yourself if you are comfortable sharing one).\nA page titled ‘About’. This page should describe who you are in greater detail. It could include your professional interests and your educational and/or professional background and/or experience. It could also include any personal information you feel conformable sharing on the website.\nA data analysis page called ‘Example analysis’. You can pick any dataset you wish you analyze. In this webpage, you will analyze a dataset and summarize the results. The requirements for this webpage are the following:\n\nYou must describe what is the question you aim to answer with the data and data analysis.\nYou must describe who is the intended audience for the data analysis.\nYou must describe and link to where the original data come from that you chose.\nYou must include a link to a data dictionary for the data or create one inside the webpage.\nYour analysis must include some minimal form of data wrangling with you using at least five different functions from dplyr or tidyr.\nYour analysis should include at least three plots with you using at least three different geom_*() functions from ggplot2 (or another package with geom_*() functions).\nPlots should have titles, subtitles, captions, and human-understandable axis labels.\nAt least one plot should using a type of faceting (facet_grid() or facet_wrap()).\nYour analysis must include one image or table (not one you created yourself, but one you have saved locally or one from the web).\nYour analysis must include at least two different callout blocks.\nYour analysis must include a .bib file, which you use to reference at least three unique citations. For example, it could be to a website or paper from where the original data came from or it could be to a paper describing a method you are using to analyze the data.\nYour analysis must include the use of at least 1 margin content.\nYou must summarize your analysis and/or results with a paragraph (4-6 sentences).\nAt the end of the data analysis, list out each of the functions you used from each of the packages (dplyr, tidyr, and ggplot2) to help the TA with respect to making sure you met all the requirements described above."

    "text": "Results\nThe purpose of this data analysis was to understand the scope of non-fatal injuries in the United States. This was done by examining the top 10 most common mechanisms by sex, and in the overall population, as well as looking at the trends in non-fatal injuries over time (from 2013-2023).\nThe top 10 most common mechanisms for non-fatal injury in general, and by sex were the same:\n\nFalls\nStruck by/ Against\nMotor Vehicle Occupant\nPoisoning\nOther Specified\nCut/Pierce\nOverexertion\nBite: Other/including sting\nForeign Body\nUnknown/Unspecified\n\nFalls, were by far, the most common mechanism for non-fatal injuries. The least common mechanism for non-fatal injuries was by a BB/pellet gun.\nFrom 2013-2020, the age-adjusted rates for non-fatal injuries in the US has been declining, irregardless of sex. However, males contributed to a higher proportion of non-fatal injuries compared to females at all years (2013-2023). The lowest age-adjusted rate was in 2020, which could be attributed to quarantine procedures during the COVID-19 pandemic, restricting mobility and interaction between individuals. Between 2021 to 2023, the age-adjusted rates for non-fatal injuries have been increasing.\nThere are several limitations of this data analysis. Firstly, the removal of the sex category “unknown”. There are numerous missing values associated with the sex category “unknown”, and so this category was removed for the purposes of this analysis. Additionally, mechanisms that were described as “Unknown/unspecified cause” were unable to be further elucidated. The latest data for year 2024 has not yet been made available, so the trend for 2024 cannot be determined.\nCurrently, WISQARs data for non-fatal injuries is not available at the state and county level, due to low statistical power. Future analyses should focus on economic costs associated with different mechanisms of non-fatal injuries (are there any causes of non-fatal injury that have high economic costs but relatively low prevalence, or vice versa?), and the spatial distribution of non-fatal injuries by geographic region in the United States.\n\n\n\n\n\n\nTipMechanism Definitions\n\n\n\nIf you are interested in reading about how each mechanism was defined, check out National Center for Injury Prevention and Control (2025)"
